In HTML/JavaScript: insert 'x' fucntion to be plotted
        change the x-interval to be plotted 

    Loads the Plotly library, 
    which will be used to generate interactive graphs

    Loads the jQuery library, 
    which is used for easier JavaScript coding and AJAX requests.

    Links to a custom CSS file for styling the page 
    (the path is dynamically generated by Flask)

    Within the HTML Body: 
        we have our form where it takes the input from user

    
    In Javascript: Dynamic Graph Updates
        updateGraph() program : 
        responsible for gathering the input data from the user 
        and sending it to the Flask backend to generate the graph

        AJAX Request: 
        Sends an asynchronous HTTP request to the Flask 
        server at the /update_graph route


        Flask evaluates the equations and 
        generates the graph in JSON format.



In Python: plot the graph that inserted by user

    importing the required libraries:
        from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
        import plotly.graph_objects as go
        import plotly.utils  # Import plotly.utils for JSON encoding
        import numpy as np
        import json
    
    we are creating the flask application name 

    creatign the graph function which responsible for generation the graph

    flask routes for rendeerign the intial HTML Page +
    Updatign the Graph (via POST request)

    Run the flak applicaton with the special name variable while calling:
        app.run(debug = True)
